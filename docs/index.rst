Welcome to PyWSD's documentation!
=================================

PyWSD is a library for interacting with WSD-enabled devices in your network.
WSD stands for Web Services for Devices, a set of technologies based on the exchange
of XML messages between devices such as a PC and a network printer, but in fact the
scope of application is theoretically broader than just printers and scanners: you could
query a WSD-enabled thermometer, for example.
